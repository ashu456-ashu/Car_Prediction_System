# Car_Prediction_System
## Overview

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the price of cars based on various features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and engine size. The model was built using the Linear Regression algorithm from the scikit-learn library. A user-friendly interface was created to allow users to input car features and receive an estimated price.
## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a reliable and accurate car price prediction system that can assist users in estimating the market value of vehicles based on specific features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system aims to provide insightful and data-driven price estimations, which can be beneficial for car dealerships, individual buyers, and sellers.
## Insights

Some of the key insights provided by this project include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features. This step was crucial in improving the accuracy of the model.
- **Model Selection**:  Linear Regression was chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness for this type of problem.
- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive user interface was developed, allowing users to easily input car details and receive price predictions. This interface makes the model accessible to non-technical users.
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis of feature importance revealed key factors influencing car prices, such as brand, year of manufacture, and mileage, providing valuable insights for users.
